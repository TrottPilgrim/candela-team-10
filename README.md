# Candela
A light filter just for your Firefox browser.

# Introduction
The candela extension works to modify your web browsing experience by modifying the color displayed in your web browser.

# Features & Benefits
Candela aims to support a wide variety of color filters and modifications in your browsing experience.

The Candela extension can protect your eyes by reducing the amount of blue light your web browser window produces when viewing content. Especially when the sun is down, it makes the color of your computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day.
