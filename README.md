Candela Extension - It protects your eyes by reducing the amount of blue light your web browser window produces when viewing content. Especially when the sun is down, it makes the color of your computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day.

It's even possible that you're staying up too late because of your computer. You could use Candela Extension because it makes you sleep better, or you could just use it just because it makes your web browsing look better.
